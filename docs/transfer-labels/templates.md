# Label Templates

These are the templates I use for loading labels into a new repository.

## Default Labels

These are my default labels, present on ALL repositories. These are based on the [Creative Commons Labelling Standards](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/repo-labels/).

```json
[

    "name": "🔒 staff only",
    "description": "Restricted to project staff members",
    "color": "7f0799"
  }
]
```

## Hacktoberfest Labels

These labels are applied when I opt in a project for the [Hacktoberfest event](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

```json
[
  {
    "name": "invalid",
    "description": "Inappropriate or invalid for Hacktoberfest contributions",
    "color": "eeeeee"
  },
  {
    "name": "Hacktoberfest",
    "description": "Good issues for Hacktoberfest participants",
    "color": "883255"
  }
]
```

## Skill Labels

This template is used to create `skill` labels, which help contributors identify the skills needed to resolve an issue so they can find issues that match their skillset.

To use this, replace `skillname` with the skill (i.e. `TypeScript` or `Angular`), then add this object to your `labels` array.

```json
{
  "name": "💪 skill: <skillname>",
  "description": "Requires proficiency in <skillname>",
  "color": "5ff1f5"
}
```

## Miscellaneous Labels

This template is used for miscellaneous uncategorised labels. Miscellaneous labels should still follow the same standard naming conventions.

```json
{
  "name": "<emoji> <category> <name>",
  "description": "text here",
  "color": "000000"
}
```
