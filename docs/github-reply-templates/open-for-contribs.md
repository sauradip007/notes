# Open For Contributions

This template is used when an issue has been marked as open to contributors, usually in tandem with the `help wanted` label. To streamline the contribution process, document the solution that a contributor should submit in their pull request. Often times, an issue with extensive discussion can leave it unclear to a contributor which solution has been accepted as the intended fix.
